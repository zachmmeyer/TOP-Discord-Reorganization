# TOP Discord Reorganization March 2020

## Basic Idea:

The Odin Discord is great. It has a good amount of text chat rooms in regards to topics and information. However, with more categories, it could be more helpful in directing users to where they could be going for general conversation on a topic or help with a specific problem. Maybe more voice chats too?

This is a rough draft:

### Role Rework

When users enter, they should be given a role like newbie, and only be allowed access to the rules and faq channel. I had a silly idea that they should have to type something in to the bot in a DM to gain access, but I think that 3 minutes is fine. Once they are good, their role should be removed. No role means mods can see if they are inactive and can be purged. No real reason to keep fake people on the server.

### Channel: Welcome

Once users are in, they are welcomed by the bot. No one should be allowed to type on this channel but the bot that welcomes new users.

### Channel: Introductions

Users sometimes post things in the welcome channel and are ignored. I think they should be encouraged to introduce themselves on the discord. They do this on the forums, they can do this here as well.

### Channel: Rules

No changes as far as I'm aware

### Channel: FAQ

No changes as far as I'm aware

### Channel: Announcements

No changes as far as I'm aware

## Category: Upper-Management

### Channel: Mods-Corner

I'm assuming this channel already exists.

### Channel: Purple-Peeps

No changes as far as I'm aware

## Category: Jail

### Channel: Odin-Court

This is where naughty people go. Users given the role of naughty or purgatory should be locked away until they've been talked to privately away from basic users, but not hidden from other mods.

## Category: The Odin Project

### TOP-in-general

Just like regular gen chat, but of course just more strict. It is where users should be able to talk about TOP, possibly ask questions. 

### Contribution-Suggestions

Users should be encouraged to discuss any contributions or changes they'd like to make to the site or the curriculum. They should also be encouraged to make those changes on github.

## Categories: VirtualBox - Rails

### Channels: [category topic general]

These is where general conversation should be had per topic.

### Channels: [category topic help]

This is where users should ask for help for the various topics brought up in the curriculum.

## Category: Getting Hired

## Category: Pair Coding

This was done before as I was told, I think it wouldn't be terrible to have again, just for users to be able to have their "Looking for Group" messages. Maybe they will get ignored, but it won't be in gen chat anymore.

## Category: Off-Topic (Random)

This is where all the normal random channels go!

Should the private channels be in their own category?

## Category: Odin Project Planning

This should obviously remain in place.
