# TOP Discord Reorganization March 2020

## Basic Idea:

The Odin Discord is great. It has a good amount of text chat rooms in regards to topics and information. However, with more categories, it could be more helpful in directing users to where they could be going for general conversation on a topic or help with a specific problem.

This is a rough draft:

### Role Rework

When users enter, they should be given a role like newbie, and only be allowed access to the rules and faq channel. I had a silly idea that they should have to type something in to the bot in a DM to gain access, but I think that 3 minutes is fine. Once they are good, their role should be removed. No role means mods can see if they are inactive and can be purged. No real reason to keep fake people on the server.

### Channel: Welcome

Once users are in, they are welcomed by the bot. No one should be allowed to type on this channel but the bot that welcomes new users.
